Php was used in the backend to submit form json data to an api using curl functionality and the form had a field for dragging and dropping image files or choosing files from the device and uploading it, specifically .jpg extension. Used transition in css for the loading animation inside a bar for upload status.
Unlike the conventional method of submitting form data using post method in php, php can also be used to send formdata in json format or other format to database, other servers or to an api end point.
